                    "text": "ML can learn patterns from data without explicit programming",
                    "correct": true,
                    "explanation": "This is the key advantage - ML algorithms can discover patterns and rules from examples rather than requiring programmers to explicitly code every scenario. Machine learning models are particularly effective when dealing with complex, high-dimensional data where the underlying patterns are not immediately obvious to human programmers. They can identify subtle correlations and relationships that would be nearly impossible to encode manually. This capability has revolutionized fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems, where the complexity of the problem space makes traditional rule-based approaches impractical."
